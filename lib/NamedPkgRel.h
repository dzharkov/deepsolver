/**\brief The relation between two packages with package specifications by name
 *
 * This class contains information about one relaytion between two
 * packages. Relation data includes version specification and relation
 * type with values from the list "less", "less or equals", "equals",
 * "greater or equals", "greater". One package from the relation defined
 * explicitly by its name in this class, the second one defined
 * implicitly by the owner of this class instance. Package specification
 * by its name is not the single way, since it can take a lot of memory
 * to store package name strings. In some cases the better way to use
 * package identifiers instead of real name strings. The usual purpose of
 * this class is to save data about package provides, requires, conflicts
 * or obsoletes entries.
