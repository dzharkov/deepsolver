 * absent in accessible repositories).

 * This type is basically  used due to performance resons.

 * packages from the accessible repositories, all installed packages and
 * packages provided by user as files in file system or by URL. Two or
 * more packages can be identify by the same VarId if they have the same
 * name, the same epoch, the same version, the same release and the same
 * build time. In all other cases packages must be considered as
 * different packages and must be identified by different values of
 * VarId. In this meaning values of VarId can be used as variables in SAT
 * formulas.
 *
 * The VarId must not be confused with PackageId type.
