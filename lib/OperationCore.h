 * structure used for configuring is a ConfigCenter class instance
 * provided by a reference to OperationCore constructor.
 *
 * According to accepted project design there are two additional classes
 * purposed for direct client using as well as OperationCore itself:
 * IndexCore and InfoCore. The former takes care about index construction
 * and the second provides various information about known
 * packages. These three classes are the main classes a end-user could be
 * interested in.
