This test compares two mapping sets: from package names to its
provides and provides sets to package names they are providing. Test
binary file takes two parameters: rpms data file (usually 'rpms.data'
or 'rpms.data.gz') and provides mapping file (usually 'provides.data)
or 'provides.data.gz'. During test execution the program prints sizes
of both mappings (must be equal) and checks the every item in each set
must be included in another. If something is wrong corresponding
assertion fails.
