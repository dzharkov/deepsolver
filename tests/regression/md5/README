This test creates several randomly generated binary files of various
size, calculates with the integrated code their md5sums and checks
these md5sums with system md5sum utility. The binary 'test' program
called by 'run' script takes two command line arguments: the name of a
file to write random data into and its length. Calculated md5sum
prints to stdout stream.

You should just call './run' command in this directory to perform the
testing.
