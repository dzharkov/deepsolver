This test must create three files:
* orig.data: randomly generated sequence of digits;
* compressed.data.gz: compressed with gzip stream from orig.data;
* decompressed.data: decompressed stream from compressed.data.

On success orig.data and decompressed.data must have the same content. The `run' script
lets be sure   everything is correct with md5sum checking.
