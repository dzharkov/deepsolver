This document describes naming conventions used in coding style in
FIXME project. Everybody is welcome to keep all rules considered below
in effect during any code changing.

Class names must begin with capital letters without any prefix. For
example, "FooBar". Any class fields marked for protected or private
access must begin with "m_" prefix, public fields may have not any
prefix.

Class methods purposed to read or write boolean flags must have "is"
substring in their names and cannot have "get" substring. For example,
in case of "FooBar" flags names must be "isFooBar() and
"setIsFooBar()".
